##the basic understanding of Devops
DevOps approach and  change in IT culture mainly focusing on rapid  deliveryof service by  adopting of agile methodology. 
The primary objective of DevOps:
1.Improvising the  deployment frequency
2. Achieve faster time to market
3. Lower failure rate 
4.Shorten lead time between fixes
5.Improve mean time to recovery
Devops enhances the te agility ,quality improves the innovation and reduce outage
DevOps workflow automation 
plan , define , develop, built , test, deployment results 
Devops Principle : 
To reduce the lead time, deployment frequency increase , robust
continous integration focusing on  code quality
continuous delivery  focusing on process quality 
continous deployer  foucusing on funtional quality 
In each face to build , checkand feedback or to deploy we have different tools.
Choosing the Right Metrics is very cruical and one of the challenge, Limited Funds
 Continous delivery pipeline management 
5 phases continous development contionous testing , continous integration , continous deployment ,continous monitoring.
product delivered by features but not complete it is generally done by 1 or 2 sprints 
code maintained by distributed version control system ex : GIT
Jenkins are used for CI: automated build and test
contionous delivery and deployment helps to detect the errors quickly.
it is not just passes tests automatically but have all the configrations necessary to push 
continious monitoring: monitoring  of system performance and overall performance is done
