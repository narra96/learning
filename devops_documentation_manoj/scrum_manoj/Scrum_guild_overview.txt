## Define scrum 

 The scrum is a lightweight framework, where it follows the cyclic development of the product within a timed sprint
 to archive reasonable solutions to the complex problems, here we repeat the cyclic until we archive predictable results.

# Basic overview of the scrum process

 1) initial step: The product owner or stakeholder will order the work with required features in a product backlog

 2) Second step: Further, the scrum team will assess the work and apply given features as an incremental value during a sprint

 3) third step: finally, the sprint output results are examined and discussed by both the scrum team and product owner and make adjustments to a new sprint

 This iterative process of the sprint is repeated until we archive predictive results from the given work.
 
 ## scrum theory
 
  1) The scrum theory based on emipiriscm and lean thinking,
  Emipiriscm: The amount of knowledge is archived through the sense of experience and also based on observed experimental results.
  Lean thinking: decrease product wastage and focus on quality.

  2) According to the scrum theory during a sprint four events are combined for the inspection and adaptation of the product.

  **The events work on the implementation of three empirical scrum pillars:

   1) Transparency: The predictive analysis process and the work-flow process must be visible for those who are performing the 
                    work and receiving the work.It enables the inspection. 

   2) inspection: Here, the artifacts archived from  the transparency are examined and frequently inspected to the agreed goals
                                                                                              to find uncertainties in the work

   3) adaptation: From the product results the deviations in the work are assessed and fixed.
   
   ## Scrum Values
    1) Commintments.
    2) focus.
    3) openness
    4) repeat
    5) & courage
    
    ## scrum team

     The scrum team is a small group (10 or lesser than it) of people who will be focused on a single task.
     The scrum team is responsible for the valuable and useful increment of product backlog features at every sprint.

      * The three responsible divisions of the scrum team.
       1) Developers: Create plans for the sprint and the sprint backlog, adaptation of plan to every day towards the sprint goal
                      check the definition is done

       2) product owner: He is mainly responsible for product backlog management.
                         Creating and clearly explaining the product backlog items and also the ordering product backlog items for the new sprint.

                         
       3) Scrum master: leads and trains the scrum teams in coaching self-management and cross-functionality skills.
                        He is totally responsible for the entire process 
                        
      ## Scrum Events
       All the events are occured in a container (sprint). The sprint is a form of opportunity to inspect and adapat scrum artifacts(artifacts are archived through transpareny)
       
      # sprint:

       They are fixed length of one month or less to create consistency against the events during inspection and adaptation
       In a sprint, all these listed works need to archive

        1) Achieve the product goal 

        2) Including the sprint planning 

        3) Daily Scrum

        4) Sprint review

        5) Sprint retrospective

      # Product goal:
       sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress towards a product goal

      # Sprint backlog: The sprint goal + the product backlog + the plan for delivering are together referred to as a sprint backlog

      # Daily scrum :
       
       The purpose of the daily scrum is to inspect the process towards the sprint goal and adapt sprint backlog as necessary and adjusting 
       the upcoming planned work.
       
      # sprint review:

       The purpose of the sprint review is to inspect the outcome of the sprint and determine future adaptation.

      # scrum artifacts:

       It represents work or value they are designed to maximize transparency of key information.

        Some of them are:

         1) For the product backlog --> product goal 

         2) For the sprint backlog --> sprint goal

         3) for the increment --> definition is done
