#Maven
##Maven Overview
- Maven is a project management and comprehensive tool
- Provides complete build lifecycle framework.
- Simplifies and standardizes the project build process
- Handles compilation , distribution, team collabration and other tasks .
..................................................................................................
##Objective 
1. Build process easy
2. Uniform build
3. Quality project information 
4. Better devlopment Practices 
- To provide comprehensive model for projects (Reusable,maintainable,easier to comprehend)
- To provide Plugins / tools that interact with declarative model 
..................................................................................................
##Project Object Model 
- Mavel project structure and contents declared in .xml file 
- POM is fundamental unit of entire maven system 
- Contains info about project and various configrations used to build project
- Contains goals and plugins
- Project Notation in repository : **groupid:artifctid:version
- default POM: Super POM
..................................................................................................
##Features
1. Simple project setup
2. Consistent usage 
3. Dependency management (includes automatic updating)
4. Extensible 
5. Easy and instant access to new features
6. Model based built
7. Using same meta data as per build process(coherence)
8. Release management and Distribution publicatons
9. Backward Compatability 
10. Automatic parent versioning
11. Parllel buils 
12. Better error and integrity reporting

##Prerequisite
-JDK 1.7 or above 
..................................................................................................
##Build lifecycle
- It is a well-defined sequence of phases
- **Phases:stage in life cycle:** validate , complile, test, package, install,deploy 
- **Three standard lifecycles:** clean, default(or build), site.
- clean :cleanup artifacts created by prior builds
- site  :generates site documentation for project
..................................................................................................
##Available plugins
- Build plugins    : Executes during build,configure build element from POM
- Reporting plugins: Executes during site generation,configure reporting element from POM
- Maven is a plugin extension framework
..................................................................................................
##Pros and Cons
**Advantage**: 
1. Same life cycle for multiple projects continuously.
- **Diasadvantage**:
1. If  maven code for an existing dependency is not available, then it is not possible to add. dependency at all.
2. Cannot handle the conflicts between versions of the same library

##Jennkins and Maven 
-Jenkins is designed for the purpose of implementing Continuous Integration (CI)
-Jenkins deploys artifacts to remote repositories, they are usually Maven repositories 
-Maven and Jenkins are distinct tools, built to fulfill distinct roles in the development lifecycle. 
Maven is part of the process for compiling code and executing tests. Jenkins controls every stage of the CI/CD pipeline. Integration resultsin facilitating a smooth and successful DevOps landscape.
