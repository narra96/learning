#DevOps 
##Waterfall Model 
- Tradition delievery model
- step by step manner 
1. - [ ] Requirement anyalysis
2. - [ ] Design
3. - [ ] DEvelopment
4. - [ ] Testing
5. - [ ] Maintence
***Cons***: 
- Restart of development cycle when new requirement given by the client 
- Lengthy 
- Expensive 
..................................................................................................
##Agile Model
- Aloows to create a prototype to understand client requirements 
- Feedback loop :comprise of four key elements (plan, code, test, review )
- Faster
The entire process of building a software broken into small accounatble blocks called Sprints 
..................................................................................................
##What is DevOps?
DevOps approach and  change in IT culture mainly focusing on rapid  deliveryof service by  adopting of agile methodology. 
- Evoluton of the agile model 
..................................................................................................
##Objective
The primary objective of DevOps:
1. Improvising the  deployment frequency
2. Achieve faster time to market
3. Lower failure rate 
4. Shorten lead time between fixes
5.Improve mean time to recovery
..................................................................................................
##Phases
- Consists of 5 phases :
 1. Continous Development
 2. Contionous Testing 
 3. Continous Integration 
 4. Continous Deployment 
 5. Continous Monitoring
..................................................................................................
Devops enhances the agility ,quality improves the innovation and reduce outage
..................................................................................................
##Devops Principle : 
To reduce the lead time, deployment frequency increase , robust
continous integration focusing on  code quality
continuous delivery  focusing on process quality 
continous deployer  foucusing on funtional quality 
..................................................................................................
##DevOps workflow automation 
-plan , define , develop, built , test, deployment results 
-In each face to build , checkand feedback or to deploy we have different tools.
Continous delivery pipeline management 
-product delivered by features but not complete it is generally done by 1 or 2 sprints 
-code maintained by distributed version control system ex : GIT
-Jenkins are used for CI: automated build and test
-contionous delivery and deployment helps to detect the errors quickly.
-it is not just passes tests automatically but have all the configrations necessary to push 
-continious monitoring: monitoring  of system performance and overall performance is done
..................................................................................................
##Challenges:
- Choosing the Right Metrics is very cruical 
- Limited Funds
